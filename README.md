The Student Record Management System is a console-based application built in C++ that helps manage student records efficiently using file handling and object-oriented programming concepts.

The system allows the user to:
✅ Add new student records with details such as Roll Number, Name, Course, and Marks.
✅ Display all student records stored in the file for review.
✅ Search for a specific student using their Roll Number.
✅ Delete a student’s record by Roll Number, updating the file automatically.
✅ Update an existing student’s details (e.g., marks or course) through Roll Number-based search and replace.

Records are stored persistently using a text file (students.txt), demonstrating practical use of file streams (ifstream, ofstream), classes, and structured data processing.
